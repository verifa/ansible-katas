Would be nice if this builds on earlier yaml. could me make sure we have written some stuff that can neatly be packed into a collection, build on the roles they made in exercise 4 to create a collection?


Create a collection skeleton with the collection init command.

Add modules and other content to the collection.

Build the collection into a collection artifact with ansible-galaxy collection build.

Publish the collection artifact to Galaxy with ansible-galaxy collection publish.
